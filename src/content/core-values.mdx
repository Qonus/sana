# Core Values

## 1. Integrity
In a world where there is a lot of misinformation spreading through the internet, especially with the recent surge of ‘AI slop’, we value truth and integrity. That’s why we will uncover this 

## 2. Accessibility
Our team understands that the reason behind the rapid spread of misinformation is that it is usually more accessible than the truth. We recognise that accessibility matters, that’s why we are going to explain what we find in a simple and understandable way.

## 3. Well-being
We believe well-being is one the most important aspects of our life. Our team wants everyone to stay healthy as long as possible. That’s why we will make it easy for everyone to keep up a healthy lifestyle.
